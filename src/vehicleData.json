    "detailed_description": "Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport  of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the world’s first orbital class  reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket,   which in turn drives down the cost of space access.",
